# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

April Showers

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets you keep track of the watering of your plants.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will use python, flask, and HTML/CSS/Javascript to create a website that first allows a user to login to their account or register for a new account. Both pages will
make sure that a username and password are entered in the fields. The login will make sure that the username and password match and correspond to an actual user. The regitter page
willmake sure tht the information  doesn't already correspond to a user and will make sure that the entered password and check for password are the same. From there, the user will
be taken to a home page where there will be a table that features a picture of each of your plants with the name and last time the plant was watered listed underneath the picture.
When you click on the pctrue, the website takes you to another page that would display the name and a desciription of the plant at the top of the web page with a table that lists a
watering history for the plant. In the table will be the the date/time that the plant was watered and the amount of water that you used (this field will be optional). In the navigation
bar, there will be a link to a page where you can create a new plant and upload the name, description, and picture of the plant that you can submit with a form. There will also be a link
in the nav bar that takes you to a form where you can enter a new water for a specific plant. The form would ask for which plant (and would make sure the plant being watered exists) is being
watered and will have an optional field to enter the amount of water. FInally, there will also be a logout link in the nav bar that logs a user out and takes them back to the login page.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TFs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will develop a website that keeps track of a barebones table of plants and the days ago that the plant was watered.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think that I can create a website that tracks the watering of plants in an aesthetically pleasing way (good formatting and design, particularly for the table).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think that I can create a website that tracks the watering of plants in a very aesthetically pleasing way while including photos of the plants aligned well in the website (excellent formatting and design).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps of my project is starting to code the HTML, CSS, and python pages that will be used to create the website. I will need to explore CSS a lot more than I previously had
and wil need to figre out how certain different functions affect the program. I will also need to aquire more skills using bootstrap design because I don't have a great grasp on how that
exactly works. I will also need to proably research good practices in designing a website with a good aesthetic (color scheme, setup etc). The fiels isn't a particular strong suit for me,
so I will definitely have to look into the display side of things more. I am working alone, so I will be responsible for all the formatting and implementation.
