Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have coded 75% of the functions in the application.py program and have begun working on the style files.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't tested/debugged all my code yet. I need to finish 3 more functions and pages on the website. I also need complete probably 50% of the css profiles.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am having trouble getting my register page to work on the website It is saying that one of the functions can not be recognized, and I am confused on how to implement it. I am also having trouble figuring out how to create a web page apsed on a specific link that you click.
For example, I'm trying set up my home page so that clicking on the link of the name of one of your plants takes you to an information page about the plant but am trying to figure out a way to implement it via one path.
